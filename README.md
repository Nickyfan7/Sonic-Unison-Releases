## What is Sonic Unison?
Sonic Unison is a Launcher Interface for Sonic 1,2,3 and Sonic Mania with support for any PC/Emulated releases of those games. It started life after the  Sonic 1,2,and CD (2011-2013) Decopmilations by RubberDuckyCooly were created and made public. 

Initially they had a menu where you could choose between the Sonic 1 and 2 RSDKs if both were provided to the executable since Sonic 1 and 2 (2013) worked on the same engine (Retro Engine Version 4) I then went on to mockup a graphical interface for the menu:<br>

<br>
However the idea of adding it to the decomps was shut down, but I didn't want to waste the assets so when someone suggested a launcher for the games akin to Sonic Between the Trilogy by CompoundGames, I jumped at it. So as time went on however what was seen above evolved into this:<br>

</br>

## So it just launches the games?
If you want to use it that way then yes, however I figured I'd try to channel the energy of the 2000's Sonic Compilations. This means there's more to it than just launching the games I plan to include an extras menu:<br>

</br>
Here you can do multiple things regarding one of the 5 Launchable games: Look at Cheat Codes, Read up about and even play a games prototype (if it's of found status), read developer interviews, the game manuals, view promotional art, and unused content from each.

Yes, this is due to the de-listing of Sonic 1,2,CD, and 3K on Steam as thanks to this the Original Versions of Sonic 1,2,and 3K and 2011 version of Sonic CD are no longer purchasable due to this some changes have been happening in the community the Retro Engine Versions of Sonic 1,2,and CD are largely unnafescted as they arestill listed on various Mobile Stores under the "Classic" series.

On the side of Sonic 3 however this means as of now there is no legal way of purchasing the original Sonic 3 & Knuckles ROM outside of the second hand market which SEGA earns no money off of anyway. Due to this Sonic 3 & Knuckles and Sonic 3 Angel island Revisited took a big hit as the Sonic 3 & Knuckles ROM was no longer for sale and Sonic 3 & Knuckles must now obtained via a cartridge dump or from a compilation such as Mega Collection. Sonic Unison does not support piracy.

## Why is my Game not Booting?
A few reasons:<br>
<ol>
<li>Wrong Drive<br>
The games should be stored on the C: Drive where the Manual says it should be.</br></li>

<li>Wrong Name/Format.<br>
The ROMS Follow the steam naming scheme but below is the naming format:</br><br>
GAMENAME_R - Base Games (Not locked-on to Sonic & Knuckles) R standing for Region in the case of Sonic CD it'd be W Still for West<br>
Sonic_Knuckles_wGAMENAME - Locked-On to Sonic & Knuckles</br></br>
Formats are the following:<br>
Sega Genesis - .bin,.md, or .68k<br>
Sega CD/Mega CD - .cue</br></li>

<li>You moved/renamed Sonic Mania.<br>
If Sonic Mania doesn't boot it's likely because you moved/renamed the EXE do not do this or Unison can't find it Unison is set to auto-detect it in it's base folder with it's base name so keep it there with it's original name SonicMania.exe</br></li>

<li>Wrong Emulator<br>
As of right now only Kega Fusion is usable with Sonic Unison so download it then your ROMS Should boot.</br></li>

<li>Prototypes
Those will have the name format similar to Steam:<br>
GAMENAME_PROTOVERSION - GAMENAME will be Sonic 1,2,CD, or 3K and PROTOVERSION being the selected Prototype the names of the Prototypes are:</br><br>
</br></li>
