## What is Sonic Unison?
Sonic Unison is a Launcher Interface for Sonic 1,2,3 and Sonic Mania with support for any PC/Emulated releases of those games. It started life after the  Sonic 1,2,and CD (2011-2013) Decopmilations by RubberDuckyCooly were created and made public. 

Initially they had a menu where you could choose between the Sonic 1 and 2 RSDKs if both were provided to the executable since Sonic 1 and 2 (2013) worked on the same engine (Retro Engine Version 4) I then went on to mockup a graphical interface for the menu:<br>

<br>
However the idea of adding it to the decomps was shut down, but I didn't want to waste the assets so when someone suggested a launcher for the games akin to Sonic Between the Trilogy by CompoundGames, I jumped at it. So as time went on however what was seen above evolved into this:<br>

Yes, this is due to the de-listing of Sonic 1,2,CD, and 3K on Steam as thanks to this the Original Versions of Sonic 1,2,and 3K and 2011 version of Sonic CD are no longer purchasable due to this some changes have been happening in the community the Retro Engine Versions of Sonic 1,2,and CD are largely unnafescted as they arestill listed on various Mobile Stores under the "Classic" series.

On the side of Sonic 3 however this means as of now there is no legal way of purchasing the original Sonic 3 & Knuckles ROM outside of the second hand market which SEGA earns no money off of anyway. Due to this Sonic 3 & Knuckles and Sonic 3 Angel island Revisited took a big hit as the Sonic 3 & Knuckles ROM was no longer for sale and Sonic 3 & Knuckles must now obtained via a cartridge dump or from a compilation such as Mega Collection. Sonic Unison does not support piracy.

## Why is my Game not Booting?
Don't worry about it it can be various factors but I plan to fix that next update by adding UDPS (User-Defined Paths) so Unison will go to the path you set for a game to launch it. from there the folder system current builds use will be retired but if you absolutely must use it now I'll have a section on the appropriate FAQS Channel for my [Discord](https://discord.gg/nRZVfNEAaK) where I will just tell you common issues I've seen users have.

UDPs are not in any of the current builds they are planned for the next update aswell as Sonic 2 Absolute Support.

## Any Other features Coming?
Yes, I plan to add themes to Sonic Unison current themes being: Dark,Light,Sonic 1/2 (90's and 10's),Sonic 3,Sonic CD (90's and 10's), and Sonic Origins.

Dark (Current Default):<br>

Don't hold your breath however UDPS are likely first up on the chopping block as they are a part of Unison's functionality.
